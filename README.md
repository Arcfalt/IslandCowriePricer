# FFXIV Island Sanctuary Cowrie to Gil Price Checker
Quick utility for checking for the best items to buy with Island Cowries in order to attempt to sell them on the marketboard for Gil. By default will check for the best profit-per-cowrie of all the dyes and materia purchasable with cowries based on the current minimum price on your world, but you can also sort different ways as desired.

Uses the Universalis API to check prices. Up to date as of Patch 7.3, and should continue to be accurate unless they change the cowrie vendor significantly in a future patch.
